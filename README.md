**ATM INTERFACE PROJECT**


**Description**

This project is a simple ATM machine simulation program created in Java using JavaFX. It allows users to perform basic ATM functionalities like:

* Login: Authenticate with a valid account number and PIN.
* Balance Inquiry: View their current account balance.
* Withdrawal: Withdraw cash from their account (with limitations).

**Features**

* User-friendly JavaFX GUI
* Basic functionalities of an ATM
* Input validation
* Error handling

**Getting Started**

1. Ensure you have Java and JavaFX installed on your system. You can download them from the following links:
    * Java: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
    * JavaFX: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/install-javafx-sdk.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/install-javafx-sdk.html)
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
4. Run the main application class (e.g., `ATM.java`).

**Running the Application**

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to compile the project:

```bash
javac ATM.java
```

3. Run the following command to execute the application:

```bash
java ATM
```

**Limitations**

This is a basic implementation and does not include advanced functionalities like:

* Database connectivity: User accounts and transactions are not stored persistently.
* Security features: The implementation does not include actual encryption or secure communication protocols.
* Deposit functionality: This version only allows for balance inquiries and withdrawals.

**Future Enhancements**

* Integrate with a database to store user accounts and transaction history.
* Implement security measures like encryption and secure communication protocols.
* Add additional functionalities like deposits, mini-statement printing, and PIN change options.
* Enhance the GUI with improved user experience elements.
